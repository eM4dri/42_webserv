# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2023-04-30 - Jorge
### Reworked
- The requests will be reprogrammed so they are treated as an object. This might take some days to be completed.

## 2023-04-28 - Jorge
### Added
- `method_get()` now identifies if the file given is a file and displays a webpage with all the files inside.
	- We'll need to check if we must show ALL the files in a directory or not (maybe hidden files or files without permission).
	- It doesn't check if the chosen directory allows showing the full list of files or not, which should be configured from `example.conf`.

### Current bugs
- **Segfault** when only a `/` is requested as a path on `getdirtest`.
- `create_directory_index()` is unable to properly identify whether the requested directory is the server's root in order to hide the `parent directory` button.

## 2023-04-25 - Jorge
### Improved
- We now consider the request to start at the established SERVER_ROOT (stored in `general.hpp` for now), and check if the request attempts to exit said ROOT.

*(Not tested on a Linux machine)* Fixed fsanitize crash when executing `./webserv dirpage`.

## 2023-04-24 - Jorge
### Added
- `method_get()` calls `return_content()` and gets the full response for a **GET** request.
	- If the requested file cannot be opened for some reason, it returns a standard `404`/`500`/`501` response.
	- There's a test in `main.cpp` to try it out with the parameter `gettest`. There's still a lot of testing left.
	- **Note:** Only the first line of the request is taken into account for now.

## 2023-04-23 - Jordi ðŸŒ¹
### Added
- Added some example files and tests in the `main`.

Fixed a few bugs on the path corrector and header parsing.

## 2023-04-22 - Edu
### Added
- `example.conf` a configuration file structured following ningx conf file structure rules.
- `src/conf` directory including:
-- `location.hpp` struct with every directive of a server location in the configuration file
-- `serverconf.hpp` class with every directive of a server in the configuration file
-- `conf.hpp` & `conf.cpp` class to parse the configuration file, handling errors properly
- Added some test on main to show it working `./webser conf`

### Changed
- Makefile now include con compile `mkdir -p $(@D)` wich creates directories needed by itself without asking explicit
- Makefile now include flag `-MMD` wich created d files in ./obj with the list of files needed to compile every object

### Fixed
- Include `<cstring> // std::strcmp` & `<iomanip> // std::setprecision` on general.hpp
- Define MACRO `st_mtime` on Directory.hpp to be able to handle time thorugh several OS following [THIS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11373505/getting-the-last-modified-date-of-a-file-in-c)
- C function `open` uses const char * as input instead of std::string fixed with c_str

## 2023-04-21 - Jorge
### Added
- Function `to_string()` used to replace C++11's `std::to_string()`.

### Fixed
- Function `create_directory_index()` now shows the correct modification date and file size.

## 2023-04-20 - Jorge
### Added
- Function `create_directory_index()` used to return an `html`-formatted string in case the user requests a directory instead of a file. *[Still work in progress]*

### Changed
- Function `get_file()` now sets a variable indicating the status of the file given (`file not found`, `unauthorized` or `is a directory`).

## 2023-04-16 - Jorge
### Added
- `Filetypes::get_suffix()` will now get the file suffix directly. It's been applied to the header generator.
	(!) We need to decide what to return if the file type isn't known.
- `return_error_message()` recieves an error code and will generate a whole response for it.
- `file_reader()` in `utils.cpp`.
Moved `Filetypes.*pp`to the `responses` directory.

## 2023-04-15 - Jorge
### Added
- `responses/responses.cpp` has some functions to retrieve files and generate a valid header to be sent to the client.
- New class `Filetypes` used to retrieve the appropriate `Content-Type` parameter for the HTTP/1.1 header.

## 2023-04-13 - Edu
### Changed
- Made cast explicit on server (`server.cpp` & `server.hpp`)

## 2023-04-09 - Edu
## Added
- Added `utils/log.hpp` to handle logs
### Changed
- Simplifying server (`server.cpp` & `server.hpp`) contains a version of pollserver including socket, ipaddress, port, and backlog and handle the process of `socket`>`bind`>`listen` as starting the server

## 2023-04-08 - Edu
### Changed
- PollServer modified with cpp's std::vector instead of c linked list

## 2023-04-09 - Jorge
### Added
- First parsing of the request and error management.
- `general.hpp` file that will be used by the other `.hpp` files to avoid including external functions multiple times.
- Utils file with a C++ equivalent `ft_split` function. More useful functions are expected.

Most things are individual functions, meaning the general program hasn't changed and the functions are not being used.

## 2023-04-08 - Edu
### Added
- Added Synchornous_IO_Multiplexing servers  (`SelectServer.hpp`, `SelectServer.cpp`, `PollServer.hpp` & `PollServer.cpp`)
### Fixed
- Getters should return const references to avoid making unnecessary copies.

## 2023-04-02 - Edu
### Added
- Added GoogleTest structure.
- Added some unit test (GoogleTest) some refinement is needed.
### Changed
- Some typos, private functions starts with '_'.
- Added some comments.

## 2023-04-01 - Edu
### Added
- Add first version of simple Webserv inspired on https://www.youtube.com/@eom-dev series C++ Web Server from Scratch. Including Makefile, structure files in folders (network, network/server, network/socket).
